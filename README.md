External services: SMTP for parent email; PDFKit for reports.
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- npm

## Installation

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Set a random `JWT_SECRET` of at least 32 characters before starting the server.

## Create the first administrator

```bash
npm run create-admin
```

The command prompts for the administrator's name, email, and password. Credentials are hashed with bcrypt and are not written to source control.

## Run

```bash
npm start
```

The default port is `3000`. Open the application through the Express server, not directly as a file, when using production authentication.

## Development UI

```bash
npm run dev
```

The existing static frontend remains available for UI exploration, while the Express server provides the production authentication and API layer.

## Quality checks

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

GitHub Actions runs these checks on pushes and pull requests.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NODE_ENV` | Runtime environment; enables secure cookies in production |
| `PORT` | HTTP server port |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Required signing secret; minimum 32 characters |
| `DB_FILE` | SQLite database file path |
| `APP_ORIGIN` | Required in production and used as the CORS origin |
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server hostname |
| `SMTP_PORT` | SMTP server port |
| `SMTP_SECURE` | Whether SMTP uses TLS directly |
| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP username |
| `SMTP_PASS` | SMTP password |
| `SMTP_FROM` | Verified sender address |

## API overview

See [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md) for request contracts and authorization rules.

- `POST /api/auth/login` — sign in
- `POST /api/auth/logout` — sign out
- `GET /api/auth/me` — current user
- `GET /api/health` — health and database check
- `GET /api/students` — administration student list
- `GET /api/students/:id/history` — authorized conduct history
- `POST /api/events` — record appreciation or sanction
- `GET /api/permissions` — authorized permission cards
- `POST /api/permissions` — create a permission card
- `PATCH /api/permissions/:code` — approve or reject a card
- `GET /api/reports/:period.pdf` — monthly, termly, or annual PDF
- `POST /api/notifications/test` — test configured SMTP delivery

## Demo data

The backend seeds sample students only when the database is empty. The records use synthetic parent contact information. Real school data should be provisioned through approved operational processes.

## Security and privacy

Student records are sensitive. Production deployments should use HTTPS, strong secrets stored outside source control, least-privilege access, database backups, retention/deletion policies, audit monitoring, rate limiting at the edge, and school-approved privacy procedures.

## Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Persist the `ecard-data` volume. Supply `.env` through the deployment environment and do not commit it.
